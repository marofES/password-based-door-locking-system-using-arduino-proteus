# password-based-door-locking-system-using-arduino-proteus
I had explained how to simulate door locking system. That is Password Based Door Locking System Using Arduino in Proteus Simulation.

same as

1. how to make a smart door lock simulation with arduino in proteus,
2. password based door lock system simulation with arduino in proteus,
3. password based lock system in proteus.

# The system can unlock and lock when the correct password is entered. You can change the password and the rotation of the servo motor in Arduino IDE. In this Video I used the Arduino keypad library for interfacing a 4x3 keypad with Arduino.

## Servo operation :
When enter the correct code the servo moves max position
with in 5 sec the servo moves to initial position
When the code wrong , the servo doesn't work

## Working :
the security system ask password
If you enter the correct code the door lock will open
and then the door close automatically with in 5 sec

## Component Requirement :

1. Arduino Uno
2. 16*2 LCD Display
3. Servo Motor
4. 4*3 Keypad 
5. 2 Led
